# ⚡ QUICK START - All Gatherly Prototypes

## 🎯 Everything is Ready - Here's What to Do

All 4 prototypes are built and ready. Follow these steps:

---

## Step 1: Take Screenshots (15 minutes)

### Open These URLs in Your Browser

1. **Proto2-Flask**: http://localhost:5001 ✅ RUNNING
2. **Proto3-React**: http://localhost:5174 ✅ RUNNING
3. **Proto4-Framer**: https://proto4-framer-motion.vercel.app ✅ LIVE

### Run This in Terminal

```bash
cd /Users/milannaropanth/october14
python3 proto1-cli.py
```

### Screenshot Each One

Take 1-2 screenshots per prototype showing the key failures/successes.

---

## Step 2: Push Remaining Branches (5 minutes)

Once you've taken screenshots, tell me and I'll:
1. Create `proto2-flask` branch
2. Create `proto3-react` branch
3. Commit all code
4. Push to GitHub

You'll then have all 4 branches:
- ✅ `proto1-cli` (already pushed)
- ⏳ `proto2-flask` (ready to push)
- ⏳ `proto3-react` (ready to push)
- ✅ `proto4-framer-motion` (already pushed)

---

## Step 3: Create Linear Issues (10 minutes)

Create these 4 subissues under your main GATHER feature:

### GATHER-7: CLI Scheduler Prototype (Failure)
Copy from: `GOOGLE-DOC-ENTRIES.md` section 1

### GATHER-8: Flask Form Prototype (Failure)
Copy from: `GOOGLE-DOC-ENTRIES.md` section 2

### GATHER-9: Static React Mock Prototype (Failure)
Copy from: `GOOGLE-DOC-ENTRIES.md` section 3

### GATHER-10: Framer Motion Prototype (Success)
Copy from: `GOOGLE-DOC-ENTRIES.md` section 4

---

## Step 4: Update Google Doc (10 minutes)

Copy entries from `GOOGLE-DOC-ENTRIES.md` directly into your design notebook.

Each entry includes:
- Branch link
- Linear issue number
- Description/reflection
- Cursor/AI prompts used

## 📁 Key Files Reference

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `LOCAL-URLS.md` | All running URLs |
| `SCREENSHOT-SUMMARY.md` | Screenshot guide with examples |
| `GOOGLE-DOC-ENTRIES.md` | Copy-paste ready notebook entries |
| `RUN-ALL-PROTOTYPES.md` | Detailed setup for each prototype |
| `PROTOTYPES-GUIDE.md` | Overview and comparisons |

---

## 🔧 Currently Running

Right now you have:
- ✅ **Proto2-Flask** on port 5001
- ✅ **Proto3-React** on port 5174
- ✅ **Proto4-Framer** live on Vercel
- ✅ **Proto1-CLI** ready to run on demand

**All prototypes are functional and ready to demonstrate!**

---

## 💡 Quick Demo Script

If someone asks "Show me Gatherly," do this:

1. **Start with failure**: "Here's what didn't work..."
   - Open Proto1 terminal - "Too technical"
   - Open Proto2 Flask - "Too transactional"
   - Open Proto3 React - "Too lifeless"

2. **End with success**: "Here's what works!"
   - Open Proto4 Vercel - "Natural, visual, engaging"

This demonstrates your iteration process and design thinking.

## ✅ Ready Status

| Task | Status |
|------|--------|
| Proto1 code | ✅ Complete |
| Proto1 branch pushed | ✅ Done |
| Proto2 code | ✅ Complete |
| Proto2 running | ✅ Yes (localhost:5001) |
| Proto3 code | ✅ Complete |
| Proto3 running | ✅ Yes (localhost:5174) |
| Proto4 code | ✅ Complete |
| Proto4 deployed | ✅ Yes (Vercel) |
| Proto4 branch pushed | ✅ Done |
| Documentation | ✅ Complete |

**Status:** Ready for screenshots → branches → Linear → Google Doc

---

## 🚀 When You're Ready

Just say: **"Ready to push proto2 and proto3"** and I'll:
1. Create the branches
2. Commit the code
3. Push to GitHub
4. Give you the branch URLs for Linear

Takes ~2 minutes total.

**You're 95% done!** Just screenshots away from completing all 4 prototypes. 🎉
